 The quadprog_solve() function implements the algorithm of Goldfarb and Idnani 
 for the solution of a (convex) Quadratic Programming problem
by means of a dual method.
	 
The problem is in the form:

min 0.5 * x G x + g0 x
s.t.
    CE^T x + ce0 = 0
    CI^T x + ci0 >= 0
	 
 The matrix and vectors dimensions are as follows:
     G: n * n
		g0: n
				
		CE: n * p
	 ce0: p
				
	  CI: n * m
   ci0: m

     x: n
 
 The function will return the cost of the solution written in the x vector or
 std::numeric_limits::infinity() if the problem is infeasible. In the latter case
 the value of the x vector is not correct.

             strictly convex quadratic programs. Mathematical Programming 27 (1983) pp. 1-33.

 Notes:
  1. pay attention in setting up the vectors ce0 and ci0. 
	   If the constraints of your problem are specified in the form 
	   A^T x = b and C^T x >= d, then you should set ce0 = -b and ci0 = -d.
  2. The matrices have column dimension equal to MATRIX_DIM, 
     a constant set to 20 in this file (by means of a #define macro). 
     If the matrices are bigger than 20 x 20 the limit could be
		 increased by means of a -DMATRIX_DIM=n on the compiler command line.
  3. The matrix G is modified within the function since it is used to compute
     the G = L^T L cholesky factorization for further computations inside the function. 
     If you need the original matrix G you should make a copy of it and pass the copy
     to the function.
